# Using a module here lets you define a separate and distinct object to which you can send the gear message
# while simultaneously conveying the idea that you donâ€™t expect to have instances of GearWrapper.
# Its sole purpose is to create instances of some other class.
# Object-oriented designers have a word for objects like this; they call them 'factories'.
